## Project Overview 

- Project: miden
- Team Name: N.A.U. MIDEN LTD
- Payment Address: 0x17FFd4654E1d506B3D449efAFf827b22f2DaF796

### Overview

N.A.U. MIDEN LTD is a true zero first Company focusing on sustainability and carbon neutrality through global innovation and use of blockchain technology. Our vision is to reconnect humanity with nature by embracing technology that paves the road towards greener societies.

miden aims in building a platform that will establish the real value of nature preservation and care. Our objectives of creating a sense of responsibility, educating the public and giving the tools to act immediately towards the establishment of greener societies generate a positive feedback loop in improving the sustainability of our actions. 

The first stage of the project will involve the issuance of unique NFT Certificates for trees planted through the platform, acting as proof of activity for individuals and businesses. Each NFT will include information such as the plantation date, tree Geolocation, the type of tree etc. This will serve in establishing a personal connection between the sponsor and the tree through gamification features as well as assisting the collection of data for accademic researches and studies. 

At the core of our platform,  will be our blockchain token acting as a representation of positive environmental behaviour. Each token will be pegged against one kilogram of greenhouse gas absorbed or saved through the actions of the platform and its stakeholder, essentially serving as a CO2 credit for individuals and businesses.

Subsequent stages of the project will include the onboarding of other carbon saving projects and activities and will reward individuals and business with CO2 credit tokens accordingly.

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

#### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce and publish at least one article/tutorial (e.g., on Medium). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

We recommended you provide social medium, like Twitter, Telegram group, or Reddit, on your website. When the developers/users need assistance, they could get in touch with you and get help.
